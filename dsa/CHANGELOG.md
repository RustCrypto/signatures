## Unreleased

### Added

- Internal sanity check validating the `r` and `s` components of the signature
- Public `OID` constant representing the object identifier defined in RFC-3279, section 2.3.2 

### Changed

- `Components::generate` now takes an `KeySize` struct instead of an `(u32, u32)` tuple
- `Components::from_components`, `SigningKey::from_components` and `VerifyingKey::from_components` are now fallible and validate themselves upon creation

### Removed

- Removed `is_valid` functions on `Components`, `SigningKey` and `VerifyingKey` (successful construction/deserialisation now implies validity)

## 0.2.0 (2022-05-16)
